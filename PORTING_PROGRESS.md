- @headlessui/react for accessible modals
- next-themes for theme management
- clsx for conditional classes
- @stripe/stripe-js for payment processing
- stripe for server-side payment processing

### Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env` file in your project root with:

```bash
# Get these from your Stripe Dashboard (https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here

# Your site URL (for Stripe success/cancel redirects)
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://foggymtndrifter.com
```

**Important:** Use test keys (sk*test*/pk*test*) for development, live keys for production.

### Path Aliases

Configured `@/*` to map to `src/*` for consistent imports.

### Client-side Hydration

Using `client:load` directive for interactive components like Providers and ModalContainer.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Configure Stripe** - Add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to .env
2. **Test the current setup** - Run `npm run dev` to see the complete layout with working payments
   - API routes are now properly configured with `prerender = false`
   - Better error handling for invalid requests
3. **Add avatar image** - Replace placeholder with actual avatar image
4. **Replace search data functions** - Implement getAllArticles and getAllProjects with real data
5. **Add missing assets** - Favicon, social images, etc.

## ðŸš¨ Known Issues

- Avatar uses placeholder (MK initials) instead of actual image
- Search API uses placeholder data functions (need to replace getAllArticles and getAllProjects)
- Path pathname tracking in AppContext simplified for Astro
- Stripe requires environment variables to be configured (see Configuration Notes below)
