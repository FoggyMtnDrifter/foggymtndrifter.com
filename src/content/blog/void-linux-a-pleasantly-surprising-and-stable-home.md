I consider myself a bit of a Linux distribution wanderer. While there's fun in exploring, it also means I rarely settle down with one distro for long. That changed when I stumbled upon Void Linux.

## My Solus Story

For over three years, I was a dedicated daily driver of Solus. Its beautiful Budgie desktop environment, well-curated software selection, and rollilng release model were a perfect fit. I especially appreciated how it offered a modern Linux experience without excessive tinkering.

Unfortunately, well-publicized infrastructure issues with Solus surfaced, causing me (and many others) concern. However, I'm pleased to say that the Solus project is back on track! This means it's still absolutely a distro I recommend, especially for those wanting a polished experience with minimal setup.

## But What About Void?

Despite Solus being back, my time with Void Linux has been incredibly positive. Here's what surprised me:

- Instead of the complex systemd suite, Void uses runit. It's refreshingly straightforward, prioritizing simplicity and a blazingly fast boot process.
- The X Binary Package System (XBPS) is fast, efficient, and reliable. It allows for building packages from source, giving incredible control over customization.
- Even as a rolling release distro, I've found Void to be incredibly stable. This is likely thanks to its testing practices.
- Despite being smaller than some distros, the Void Linux community is active and welcoming. The documentation is top-notch.

## Which Is Right For You?

Both Solus and Void offer compelling reasons for being your home distro:

- If you prioritize a polished out-of-the-box experience, a curated software selection, and want minimal tinkering, Solus is a fantastic solution.
- If you enjoy customization and don't mind a bit more hands-on setup, Void Linux could be your new favorite.

## Sticking Around for Awhile

While I loved the Solus experience, I've been absolutely blown away by Void's reliability, speed, and philosophy. After my experience, I don't see myself distro-hopping anytime soon; though it's wonderful to have Solus back as a strong option too!

If you share my priorities, I strongly encourage you to give Void Linux a chance. If you prefer a more polished experience, definitely check out the revitalized Solus project. Either way, you might just find your new Linux home!
