## Introduction

Welcome to my personal website, FoggyMtnDrifter.com ("I", "me", "my"). Your privacy is important to me, and this Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your personal information when you visit FoggyMtnDrifter.com ("Website").

## Information I Collect

I strive to minimize data collection and only collect necessary information:

- **Automatically Collected Information:** I use Rybbit Analytics, a privacy-focused analytics tool, to collect non-personal, aggregated data about Website usage. This includes page views, referral sources, and device types. The analytics are designed to respect user privacy while providing essential insights into website usage.
- **Contact Information:** If you voluntarily provide your name or email (e.g., through a contact form or newsletter signup), I collect and store this information securely.
- **Payment Information:** When you use the Tip Me feature:
  - Payment processing is handled securely by Stripe, a PCI-compliant payment processor
  - I do not store your credit card information
  - Stripe may collect your name, email, payment method details, and transaction history
  - For recurring tips, Stripe maintains the subscription information needed to process monthly payments

## How I Use Your Information

I use collected information for the following purposes:

- To analyze traffic and improve the Website's content and usability.
- To respond to inquiries and communicate with you if you provide your contact information.
- To process your tips and manage recurring subscriptions through Stripe.
- To send you receipts and important updates about your recurring tips (if applicable).

## Cookies and Tracking

This website uses minimal tracking. Rybbit Analytics is configured to respect user privacy while collecting essential usage data. Stripe may use essential cookies for payment processing and fraud prevention.

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

I do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties, except:

- With Stripe for payment processing
- When required by law or necessary to protect my rights

## Data Security

I take appropriate security measures to protect any information collected. While no system is 100% secure, I strive to use best practices to safeguard data. Payment processing is handled by Stripe, which maintains industry-standard security measures.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location you may have the right to request access to, modify, or delete any personal information you have provided. For payment-related data:

- You can cancel recurring tips through the [Website's cancellation page](/cancel-subscription)
- Payment data is managed by Stripe according to their privacy policy
- If you need to update payment information or have concerns, please contact me at michael@foggymtndrifter.com
